# transport-system-analysis
Piece of software that allows to download the data on city's transport system from OSM API, build the graph with interchanges and analyze the shortest routes for optimality.

How to run the script?

1. dump.py
2. graphs.py
3. interchanges_to_graph.py
4. calculate.py
5. get_paths.py

I ask whether to add "bus", "trolleybus" and "train" because of intercity buses, trolleybuses (Urgench-Xiva, Yalta) and 
trains
