Transport System Analysis -- Copyright (C) 2020, Alexander Tsyba
Comes under GNU GPL v3

dump.py is the first step in transport system analysis - downloading routes and
stations of specified cities into SQLite database. This is a needed evil as
it is much easier to work with info from local DB vs. referring to API
anytime for different actions like building graphs and analysing shortest paths.

Cities are taken from cities.txt (or cities_man.txt, if you want to enter them
manually) in the format [city, country] in English;

In case you get a Nominatim error, OSM does not recognize the city in the way
you've written it;

If your Internet connection was interruped, you can rerun the script - data
should be maintained in DB and Pycache and continue downloading from the
place you've stopped;

Next step after dump.py is graphs.py to build non-connected graph object first.
